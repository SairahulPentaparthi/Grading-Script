## Submissions Folder

This folder contains all of the submissions for a particular assignment. This should be run in batch as the overhead of starting and setting up the script on a single TA's machine may hinder in efficiency. The files once graded and tallied on the CSV files will be moved to the correct folder. 

A file needs to be regraded, if it has an error or if the score is too low (the score cutoff is a constant you can set in Grade.py). The files that need to be regraded will be moved to the regrade folder with a file of their errors. <i> Future scripts can be created to divide the regrade files into folders for TAs to grade </i>

The grades and comments will be available in a <i>CSV file </i> and should be uploaded to Google Drive for the other TAs to reference

#### These files be graded only once and are moved for that reason
