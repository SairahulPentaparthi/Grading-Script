## Graded Folder

This folder contains the assignments that are graded and no longer need grading. Scores should range from 30 to 100 points. 

The grades and comments will be available in a <i>CSV file </i> and should be uploaded to Google Drive for the other TAs to reference

#### These files should not be regraded
